# A basic practical overview of Django and Geodjango

## About the Author

Samuel Gachuhi is a data scientist who has a background in Geography and Environmental Studies. Some years after university, he began teaching himself to programme. He still finds it fun to teach and showcase others what he's created and learnt over time.

## Purpose of writing this book

I decided to write this book to help anyone else out there who desires to be taught Django in a friendly way. This book was intended to be a tutorial on how you would get basics of Django while building a very simple app. 

Though the books has its own limitations, inconsistencies and imperfections, it is my desire it will contribute to increasing your knowledge and understanding of how Django works.
