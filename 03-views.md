# Chapter 3: A Django view

## Add the app 

We add apps inside the `settings.py` file under the project folder, and in this case `sanitation` since its the name of our project. Go back to [Chapter 1](01-installing.md#chapter-01-installing-django) to refresh your memory on how we created a project and an app directory.

To include an app in your project, you need to reference to its configuration class at the beginning of the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings` file.

This enables Django know that there is a new app in town.

In order to display something for our app, we have to create a view.

## Create a view

A view in Django is a collection of functions or classes inside the `views.py` file in an app's directory. Each function or class handles the logic that the app processes each time the user visits a different URL.

The `views.py` file is found under your app's directory, which is `australia` in this case.

Inside the `australia/views.py` file, insert the following code.

```
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return render(request, "australia/home.html", {})
```

In this piece of code, you define a **view function** named `home()`. When you call this function, it'll render an HTML file named `home.html`.

**NB**: A view function takes at least one argument, request. The request object is created whenever a page loads, and it contains metadata about the page request.

Now that you’ve created the view function, you need to create the HTML template to display to the user. The `render()` function looks for HTML templates inside a directory called `templates/` in your app directory. Since templates of different apps can have the same names, it’s also best practice to add a subdirectory with the app’s name inside the `templates/` directory.

Create the `templates/` directory, a subdirectory named `pages/`, and subsequently a file named `home.html` inside it.

Once you’ve created the template folders and `home.html`, open the HTML file in your editor and add the following lines of code:

`<h1>Australia, welcome</h1>`

For clarity, here is the directory structure of our `australia` app.

```
australia
├── apps.py
├── templates
│   └── australia
│       └── home.html
├── views.py

--snip--
```

Now that you’ve created the template that your `home()` view function expects, you need to tell Django when to serve the view. For this, you need to create a new route to the project.
